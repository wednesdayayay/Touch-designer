# Touch-designer
Some of the various Touch designer patches I'm working on


as I add more patches they will get organized into types


mostly we will be looking at 

utility modules, 
LZX module emulations and 
things of my own creation


The goal is to be able to look at the inner workings of video synthesis concepts and workflows to gain a better understanding overall

all modules will have custom control panels so they can easily be mapped in anyway you prefer



**Dreamweaver**
quad oscillator cluster /> ramp creator > ramp effector
the quad osc can be used to modulate the ramps 
then there are lots of ways to change the ramps (mirror, color, feedback etc..)
this is our first TD video synth voice


**FKG3**
this is an emulation of the LZX FKG3 module
FG,BG,Key RGB compositing

**coming in the future**
topogram (just needs cleaning)
arch / DSG3 (core concepts are worked out)
4 quadrant multiplier (a building block that gets used all over the place)
video looper (already done just needs cleaning)
video looper / temporal displacement (cleaning)
colorizer (topogram > matrix mixer > composite types at the heart haven't started)
Scrawl (our rpi video painter) needs a full rebuild
